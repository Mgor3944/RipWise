# RipWise

RipWise is a smart beach safety kiosk designed to keep beachgoers safe at unpatrolled beaches by identifying rip currents, 
displaying safe swimming zones, and providing multilingual education on beach hazards. Our system uses machine learning and live video feeds 
to deliver real-time safety insights, targeting areas where traditional beach patrolling is unavailable.
